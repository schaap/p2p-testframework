# A very simple processor that simpy saves the hostname of the host on which each execution was done.
#
# This module expects the following raw logs to be present:
# - None
#
# This module expects the following parsed logs to be present:
# - None
#
# This module outputs the following generated files:
# - hostname_$execNum
# -- contains one line: the hostname (and possibly port) of the host on which execution $execNum ran

# Please return false (non-0) when an error occurs, instead of calling fail.
# The way the settings are saved into ${LOCAL_TEST_DIR}/processors/proc_$PROCESSOR_NUMBER/ does not matter, but make sure it exists and that ${LOCAL_TEST_DIR}/processors/proc_$PROCESSOR_NUMBER/modulename contains the module subtype and nothing else.
