This document contains all parameters that can be used with the delivered framework. It's main subdivision is by module type (i.e. scenario, file, host, client, etc) and those are divided into the extension modules that exist for that module. Note that when looking for akll parameters of an extension module, you should add the parameters of the parent module as well. So, for example, when looking at host:ssh one can see that hostname, user and port are parameters, but also name and remoteDirectory, etc.

If you're not sure yet how to use these parameters, please read the HOWTO and/or the README first.

= scenario =
- name          The name of the scenario. Required.
- file          Path to a file on the local machine to be included in the scenario description. Required.
                May be specified multiple times, in which case the scenario description is the concatenation of the specified files.
- parallel      Set to 'no' to make the scenario be handled sequentially. It will definitely be slower, but this can alleviate
                problems with too many threads. Note that the relative timing of the clients is about the same as parallel handling.
                Optional, defaults to '' which specified parallel handling.
- timelimit     Positive integer number of seconds that specifies the maximum amount of time a scenario is allowed to run.
                This limit only goes for the actual running, so from the moment the clients are started they are allowed to run for
                this time. Optional, defaults to 600.
- timeout       Alternative name of timelimit.


= host =
Note that the parameters of the tc modules are also part of the host object. See the README for more on that.

- name                  The name of the host object. This name is used to refer to the host object in throughout the scenario.
                        Usually required (particular extension modules sometimes provide a default)
- remoteDirectory       The path to a directory on the remote host which can be used to store temporary files in during the scenario.
                        Optional, a temporary directory will be created by default (in /tmp usually)
- tc                    The name of the TC module to load, without any prefixes. E.g. tc=netem to load the tc:netem module
                        on the host. Optional, empty by default which disables TC. By default tc=netem is provided in the tc:netem
                        module.
- tcInterface           The name of the interface on which traffic control is to be applied. This should be an existing
                        networking interface on the remote host. Optional, defaults to eth0
- tcMaxDownSpeed        Maximum download speed to allow. To be specified in bits per second, possibly postfixed by kbit or mbit.
                        E.g. tcMaxDownSpeed=10mbit for 10 mbit speeds. Optional, defaults to 0 meaning no restrictions
- tcMaxDownBurst        Maximum burst in the download speed. Not allowed if tcMaxDownSpeed is not set. To be specified in bits
                        per second. Optional, defaults to equal to tcMaxDownSpeed
- tcMaxUpSpeed          Like tcMaxDownSpeed, but for upload speed.
- tcMaxUpBurst          Like tcMaxDownBurst, but for upload speed.
- tcLossChance          Chance to drop a packet. A floating point number between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive, specifying the chance
                        as a percentage. Optional, defaults to 0.0
- tcDuplicationChance   Chance that a packet will be duplicated. A floating point number between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive,
                        specifying the chance as a percentage. Optional, defaults to 0.0
- tcCorruptionChance    Chance that a packet will be corrupted. A floating point number between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive,
                        specifying the chance as a percentage. Optional, defaults to 0.0
- tcDelay               The delay to introduce on each packet in ms, given as a positive integer. Optional, defaults to 0
- tcJitter              The maximum deviation on the introduced delay, as set by tcDelay, in ms. Optional, defaults to 0


== host:local ==
Uses the local host, mainly for testing. If you wish to use the local host for serious scenarios consider using host:ssh to 127.0.0.1.

- [none]

== host:ssh ==
Uses a host that can be approached via SSH. This is the preferred way of contacting hosts.

- hostname      The hostname of the host to be used over SSH. Hostnames and IP addresses are accepted.
- port          The port on which the SSH daemon listens on the host; optional, defaults to 22.

== host:das4 ==
Special handler for those with access to the DAS4 system.

- headnode              The hostname of the DAS4 host to SSH to initially. Optional, if left out the module
                        will try and determine which network you're on and use the local entry node. If
                        you're not on one of the networks of the institutes hosting DAS4 this will give an
                        error.
                        
                        The automated lookup test uses dig -x for a reverse lookup on any inet address found
                        in ifconfig, except 127.0.0.1, and tries to see if it matches any of the following
                        networks:
                            network        headnode
                            -------        --------
                            .vu.nl         fs0.das4.vu.nl
                            .liacs.nl      fs1.das4.liacs.nl
                            .uva.nl        fs4.das4.science.uva.nl
                            .tudelft.nl    fs3.das4.tudelft.nl
                            .astron.nl     fs5.das4.astron.nl
                        Note that fs2.das4.science.uva.nl won't be used automatically.
                        
                        The above table also holds all valid values for this parameter, unless the

- nNodes                The number of nodes to request, a positive integer. Optional, defaults to 2.
- reserveTime           A positive number of seconds to reserve the nodes; note that you should take into 
                        account that the nodes need to be reserved during setup, so some setup steps can
                        still occur between reservation and the actual running of the test scenarios. It
                        is recommended to reserve the nodes for a few minutes more than the maximum
                        execution time of the scenario. Optional, defaults to 900.
- user                  The username to use for logging in on the DAS4 system. Required.
- headnodeOverride      Set to anything but "" to override the validity checks on the headNode parameter.
                        Use this for custom headNodes or to bypass DNS lookups by providing the IP of the
                        headnode. Optional.

                    goes right, please make sure the string "Seeding" is not to be found in the names of torrents or other

                    multiple times. If apply is enver specified then all clients that are part of a (non-seeding) execution are
                    added as soon as all objects have been loaded.
